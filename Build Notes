Most of the responsibilities seem to be devolved to the room with the manager merely checking people in and out and interrogating the the various status indicators of the rooms. This would be a good candidate for a room dashboard showing in one view the value of all the values for each room.

Store the songs, rooms etc in hashes. Once they are in there we can work with them in the relvant classes


When making a class that's required by another, make sure I pass the method that returns what I want rather than passing the object itself to the other class. I was looking for the array of the default song list and I was passing a room object the default song list class. Wrong! I just want the list of default songs...accessible using the method.
