Store the songs, rooms etc in hashes. Once they are in there we can work with them in the relvant classes


When making a class that's required by another, make sure I pass the method that returns what I want rather than passing the object itself to the other class. I was looking for the array of the default song list and I was passing a room object the default song list class. Wrong! I just want the list of default songs...accessible using the method.
